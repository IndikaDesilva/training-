        fortios_ipv4_policy:
          id: 4 # required. Policy ID. Warning: policy ID number is different than Policy sequence number. The policy ID is the number assigned at policy creation. The sequence number represents the order in which the Fortigate will evaluate the rule for policy enforcement, and also the order in which rules are listed in the GUI and CLI. These two numbers do not necessarily correlate: this module is based off policy ID. TIP: policy ID can be viewed in the GUI by adding 'ID' to the display columns
